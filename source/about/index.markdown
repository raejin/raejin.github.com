I am an undergraduate major in Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I will graduate in Spring 2014. I do not know where I am going at this point. Normally, people would relate computer science major to Silicon Valley or San Francisco start-ups. These are great choices, and I do hope I end up going somewhere awesome. But I don't know what kind of software developer I will turn into, so I am trying the best to shape/sharpen myself.

I originally came from Taiwan and I have stayed at the Bay Area for 3 years. I hadn't received official programming education until I came to the Bay Area. However, I have witnessed and participated in the history of the Internet since 1999. I am no any different from a lot of 90s kids. We dream about Internet since the 56k modem making its noise. I started experiencing web programming back then and I could not stop my fascination about it.

I love Web. It never stops evolving and developers continue to shape web development to its best practice. It doesn't entirely follow traditional software development pattern because it has its own rule. The fact that it has changed dramatically in 14 years keeps me excited. And I know this is where I belong.

Although I know what I want to do, I still need to do my homework. I know this career path will always encourage me to learn. Thus, this blog is named after my passion for front-end development - WATCH AND LEARN.
