Whenever I need to decide a specific color to use, I always consult my sweet Photoshop CS6 since it runs pretty smooth on my laptop. But this is an overkill, opening up Photoshop simply for picking a color sounds so stupid and Iâ€™ve been doing this for years.

Luckily, I stumble upon [this article](http://yuji.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/mac-adding-hex-color-picker-to-color-picker/) about how to configure a light-weight hex color picker app on a Mac. Although the article clearly maps out all the steps, I am still presenting it here:

1. Download [Hex Color Picker](http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/)
2. Open AppleScript Editor
3. Write the desired app name i.e. `ColorPicker`
4. Save as a file with `.app` as file extension
5. Move the file `HexColorPicker.colorPicker` to `~/Library/ColorPickers`

Simple, elegant, no more Photoshop :)
