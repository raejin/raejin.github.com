Hello! Summer 2013 officially started :-)

Today is the second day of the summer, and I feel pretty good about having a fresh start despite the fact that I did waste yesterday just to have beers with my friends. All in all, life’s good after the final exams, YAY!

This summer I will be working on Ruby on Sinatra, along with some light-weight front-end framework. Therefore, in order to get ready for my internship, I am setting up a reading list so that I don’t just blindly work on something without understanding the fundamentals.

Although I don’t think the project I will be working on requires any kind of sophisticated front-end work, I still want to learn the trendy hipster-ish front-end JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS, KnockoutJS, or EmberJS.

Here is the reading list of the books and the useful tutorials:

### Online resources

- [AngularJS video tutorial on Egghead.io](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP6DbQBkn9ymGQh2qpk9ImLHdSH5T7yw7)
- [JavaScript Style Guide by jQuery](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
- [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide (Re-read again)](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- [Rails Intro, Deep Dive: RVM](http://rubysource.com/rails-development-101-rvm/)
- [Sinatra Intro](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Haml](http://haml.info/)
- [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)

### Books reference

- [Sinatra: Up and Running](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920019664.do)
- [JavaScript The Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do)
- [High Performance Web Sites - Essential Knowledge for Front-End Engineers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529307.do)
- [Ruby on Rails Tutorial, Second Edition](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/)
- [Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmers’ Guide](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9)

So far I found Ruby very magical and pseudo-intuitive to learn, but as coming from a less-dynamic programming language, I sometimes found I am doing too much work for what should’ve been done in two lines of code. I need to practice write less code in Ruby to achieve maximum efficiency. I will continue to update this list as I found useful resources.

It’s already a great start, cheers Rae!
