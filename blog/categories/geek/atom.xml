    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alright, I know the title is a bit off. I could've still suffered if I don't study well enough to handle the finals. I've discovered a OSX application called SelfControl to prevent me from wondering on social websites occasionally for a period of time.</p>

<p><a href="http://selfcontrolapp.com/">This app</a> is really awesome if you are the kind of person like me who lacks self-discipline whenever there is a need to focus. Well, mainly the reason is I don't really like the material and it is hard in general, so that pushed me off from being proactive about the finals.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this app is powerful enough to keep me from cracking the rules. It claims that after the rules are set, there is no way to break the rules even uninstalling the app. So there you have it! In case someone is looking for some help to get focused studying for exams.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This semester I am taking a self-paced UNIX class, which is a lot more fun compared to the other theoretical-ish computer courses. Sometimes I really lack motivation to learn effective UNIX commands to make my life easier. And I don't think I'm alone, but in order to be a legit software enginner I must at least not suck at the basics.</p>

<p>Last week I ran to an UNIX tutor asking some dumb questions from the text, and I finally realized that piping is not restricted to a single input command! I wonder why it took me so long to notice this trivial fact, why!!!!????</p>

<p>Here it goes, I need to remind myself how dumb I was/am and hopefully I stay motivated to be an effective engineer.</p>

<p><code>
$ cat someFile | comm -12 - anotherFile
</code></p>

<p>It's the hyphen that makes this works beautifully! Who would have thought of using hyphen? Who?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I need to decide a specific color to use, I always consult my sweet Photoshop CS6 since it runs pretty smooth on my laptop. But this is an overkill, opening up Photoshop simply for picking a color sounds so stupid and I've been doing this for years.</p>

<p>Luckily, I stumble upon <a href="http://yuji.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/mac-adding-hex-color-picker-to-color-picker/">this article</a> about how to configure a light-weight hex color picker app on a Mac. Although the article clearly maps out all the steps, I am still presenting it here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/">Hex Color Picker</a></li>
<li>Open AppleScript Editor</li>
<li>Write the desired app name i.e. <code>ColorPicker</code></li>
<li>Save as a file with <code>.app</code> as file extension</li>
<li>Move the file <code>HexColorPicker.colorPicker</code> to <code>~/Library/ColorPickers</code></li>
</ol>


<p>Simple, elegant, no more Photoshop :)</p>
