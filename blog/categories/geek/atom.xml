    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This semester I am taking a self-paced UNIX class, which is a lot more fun compared to the other theoretical-ish computer courses. Sometimes I really lack motivation to learn effective UNIX commands to make my life easier. And I don't think I'm alone, but in order to be a legit software enginner I must at least not suck at the basics.</p>

<p>Last week I ran to an UNIX tutor asking some dumb questions from the text, and I finally realized that piping is not restricted to a single input command! I wonder why it took me so long to notice this trivial fact, why!!!!????</p>

<p>Here it goes, I need to remind myself how dumb I was/am and hopefully I stay motivated to be an effective engineer.</p>

<p><code>
$ cat someFile | comm -12 - anotherFile
</code></p>

<p>It's the hyphen that makes this works beautifully! Who would have thought of using hyphen? Who?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I need to decide a specific color to use, I always consult my sweet Photoshop CS6 since it runs pretty smooth on my laptop. But this is an overkill, opening up Photoshop simply for picking a color sounds so stupid and I've been doing this for years.</p>

<p>Luckily, I stumble upon <a href="http://yuji.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/mac-adding-hex-color-picker-to-color-picker/">this article</a> about how to configure a light-weight hex color picker app on a Mac. Although the article clearly maps out all the steps, I am still presenting it here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/">Hex Color Picker</a></li>
<li>Open AppleScript Editor</li>
<li>Write the desired app name i.e. <code>ColorPicker</code></li>
<li>Save as a file with <code>.app</code> as file extension</li>
<li>Move the file <code>HexColorPicker.colorPicker</code> to <code>~/Library/ColorPickers</code></li>
</ol>


<p>Simple, elegant, no more Photoshop :)</p>
