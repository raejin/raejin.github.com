    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alright, I know the title is a bit off. I could've still suffered if I don't study well enough to handle the finals. I've discovered a OSX application called SelfControl to prevent me from wondering on social websites occasionally for a period of time.</p>

<p><a href="http://selfcontrolapp.com/">This app</a> is really awesome if you are the kind of person like me who lacks self-discipline whenever there is a need to focus. Well, mainly the reason is I don't really like the material and it is hard in general, so that pushed me off from being proactive about the finals.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this app is powerful enough to keep me from cracking the rules. It claims that after the rules are set, there is no way to break the rules even uninstalling the app. So there you have it! In case someone is looking for some help to get focused studying for exams.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I need to decide a specific color to use, I always consult my sweet Photoshop CS6 since it runs pretty smooth on my laptop. But this is an overkill, opening up Photoshop simply for picking a color sounds so stupid and I've been doing this for years.</p>

<p>Luckily, I stumble upon <a href="http://yuji.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/mac-adding-hex-color-picker-to-color-picker/">this article</a> about how to configure a light-weight hex color picker app on a Mac. Although the article clearly maps out all the steps, I am still presenting it here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/">Hex Color Picker</a></li>
<li>Open AppleScript Editor</li>
<li>Write the desired app name i.e. <code>ColorPicker</code></li>
<li>Save as a file with <code>.app</code> as file extension</li>
<li>Move the file <code>HexColorPicker.colorPicker</code> to <code>~/Library/ColorPickers</code></li>
</ol>


<p>Simple, elegant, no more Photoshop :)</p>
